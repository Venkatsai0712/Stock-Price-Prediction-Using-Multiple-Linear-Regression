**Project Title:** Tesla Stock Price Prediction with Multiple Linear Regression

**Description:**

This repository implements multiple linear regression to predict Tesla's stock prices based on historical data. It aims to demonstrate the process of:

1. Data acquisition and preprocessing (e.g., downloading, cleaning, handling missing values)
2. Feature selection and engineering (identifying and preparing relevant features)
3. Model building and training (applying multiple linear regression)
4. Model evaluation (assessing performance using metrics like R-squared and mean squared error)
